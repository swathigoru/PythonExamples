Amazon web services
comprises dozens of services,
each of which exposes an area of functionality.
While the variety of services offers flexibility
for how you want to manage your AWS infrastructure,
it can be challenging to figure out which services to use and how to provision them.
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy
and manage applications in the AWS cloud
without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.
